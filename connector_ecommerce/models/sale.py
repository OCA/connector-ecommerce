    """Add a cancellation mecanism in the sales orders

    When a sales order is canceled in a backend, the connectors can flag
    the 'canceled_in_backend' flag. It will:

    * try to automatically cancel the sales order
    * block the confirmation of the sales orders using a 'sales exception'

    When a sales order is canceled or the user used the button to force
    to 'keep it open', the flag 'cancellation_resolved' is set to True.

    The second axe which can be used by the connectors is the 'parent'
    sales order. When a sales order has a parent sales order (logic to
    link with the parent to be defined by each connector), it will be
    blocked until the cancellation of the sales order is resolved.

    This is used by, for instance, the magento connector, when one
    modifies a sales order, Magento cancels it and create a new one with
    the first one as parent.
